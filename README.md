## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. using [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble):

```bash
# requires Nim v1.6 or greater
$ nimble install mcsrvstat.nim
```

2. (upcoming) using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
$ brew install mcsrvstat.nim
```

<br>

## âš¡ Usage

This package, AKA mcsrvstat.nim, is a [hybrid package](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#hybrids). Meaning that it can be used as both a Nim library and a standalone CLI application inside your terminal. <br>

### ... as a CLI application

After installing the package from [the Installation section](#installation) section, the binary for mcsrvstat.nim should be in your `PATH` depending on how you've installed it. This means, a new `mcsrvstat` command will be added to your shell environment. Simply run it using the following commands:

```bash
# The default help command.
$ mcsrvstat --help  # -h also works

# Fetching a Minecraft: Java Edition server.
$ mcsrvstat hypixel.net

# Fetching a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server.
$ mcsrvstat mco.mineplex.com --bedrock
```

### ... as a Nim library

Aside of the CLI binary, mcsrvstat.nim can also work as a Nim library as mentioned once before. You'll have to install the package using [Nimble (redirect to Installations section)](#ðŸ“¦-installation) and then you're done setting up. Here is some basic code for you to get started with:

```nim
# Imports.
import std/[
    asyncdispatch,
    strformat
]
import mcsrvstatpkg/base

# Defining a Server object instance. This represents a Minecraft server.
let server = Server(
    address: "hypixel.net",
    platform: Platform.JAVA  # The Platform enum is used to define the edition of the server.
)

# Making a main() async procedure to run our code.
proc main() {.async.} =
    await server.refreshData()  # Loads the server data into memory.

    if server.online:
        echo fmt"Server running on: {server.ip} (port {server.port})"
    else:
        echo "Server is offline!"

# Running it.
waitFor main()
```

For more procedures and use cases, you can visit the [official documentation](https://hitblast.github.io/mcsrvstat.nim) and view the different types, examples and procs.

## ðŸ”¨ Building

The default build configuration (development) for this project is kept in the root [config.nims](https://github.com/hitblast/mcsrvstat.nim/blob/main/config.nims) file. You can easily build binaries using the following commands:

```bash
# development
$ nimble build --accept

# release
$ nimble -d:release build --accept
```

The dependencies used for developing this project are:

1. The [argparse (>= 4.0)](https://nimble.directory/pkg/argparse) library, for parsing command-line arguments for the CLI binary.
2. The [illwill (>= 0.3)](https://nimble.directory/pkg/illwill) library, for the terminal user interface (TUI).
